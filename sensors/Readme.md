# Package overview
This folder contains a very generic sensor model to imitate the correct interfaces and noise properties. It supports a specific sensor sample rate, a sensor delay, variance (of white noise) and seed for random number generation. White noise is generated by a Gaussian normal distribution. For further details consult documentation in the sensor model GUI when double-clicking on the simulink model.


In addition, the sensor model allows multiple failure modes to be enabled on the sensor. Find further details about the failure modes within the model block (for a normal working sensor input *Zero*).
